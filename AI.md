## Motivation

My motivation for using AI is to improve wordings and UI design, while I implement the logic by myself for learning purposes.

I find that AI can be a valuable tool in enhancing the overall user experience and making the application more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Changes

After implementing Level 4, I used VSCode's copilot (GPT 4.1) to change the `println` outputs to make the UI more consistent and user-friendly.

I've also used AI to generate additional test cases and ensure the chatbot behaves as expected in various scenarios.
